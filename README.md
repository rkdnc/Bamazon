An Amazon-esque Command Line Interface app that interacts with MySQL and Node.JS

Users are greeted with an initial display of all items in the database, along with their [prices](images/programBegin.png).

After a user inputs the ID number of the item they would like, they are promted to enter their desired [quantity](images/purchaseAmount.png).

Once the user has seleced an amount, they are provided with the total value of their [purchase](images/purchaseComplete.png), and the [database reflects the change](images/purchaseAmount.png)
